The concept of falsy value is when the value of the condition statement is expected to be false or it has no value, the JavaScript will automatically convert the value to false. Here are the 3 examples of falsy values: “”, 0, and null. “” (Empty string) considered as falsy because it shows the absent of textual context or value. 0 (number zero) considered as falsy because it shows the absent of numerical value (0 when used in conditional statemen is always consider as false). null considered as falsy because null represent the absence of any object value.
